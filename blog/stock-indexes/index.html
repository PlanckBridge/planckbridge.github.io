This post explores the study’s implications and introduces momentum trading.</p><h2 id=the-dow-jones-industrial-average>The Dow Jones Industrial Average</h2><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (The Dow) was created in 1896 by Charles Dow, a journalist and co-founder of Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. Initially, the index included 12 companies. Charles Dow calculated the index value by hand each day, adding the stock prices of these companies and dividing the total by 12.</p><p>The Dow has evolved over time to include a broad range of industries and now consists of 30 companies. A committee at S&amp;P Global decides which companies are included in the index. Below is a screenshot from S&amp;P Global’s website describing their selection process:</p><p><img src=/images/dow.png alt=Dow></p><p>For more details, you can read the original document <a href=https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/methodology/article/dow-jones-averages-methodology/>here</a>.</p><p>According to S&amp;P Global, the selection process focuses on companies with a strong track record and widespread public trust. In other words, companies with a positive trend.</p><h2 id=the-sp-500>The S&amp;P 500</h2><p>Standard & Poor’s (S&amp;P), a corporate division of S&amp;P Global, introduced the S&amp;P 500 index in 1957. The creation of the S&amp;P 500 index was enabled by technological advancements that allowed for efficient calculations and regular updates. In 1957, the technology available could have handled every stock on the New York Stock Exchange, but S&amp;P chose to include only 500 stocks, based on criteria that ensured the index reflected the most relevant and representative companies in the U.S. economy.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 Index is reviewed and rebalanced quarterly by the U.S. Index Committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. The full methodology for selecting companies is detailed <a href=https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf>here</a></p><p>S&amp;P Global summarizes the selection process as shown below:</p><p><img src=/images/selection.png alt=Selection></p><p>The original document is available <a href=https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/sp-500-brochure.pdf>here</a>.</p><p>I’d like to highlight that, to be included in the index, companies must meet a minimum market capitalization requirement. This threshold has increased over time. For instance, between 2011 and 2024, the minimum market capitalization required for inclusion in the index has risen by 350%, as shown on S&amp;P Global’s website:</p><p><img src=/images/cap.png alt=Cap></p><p>This shows that companies included in the index, and those that remain in it, tend to experience significant growth in their market capitalization and maintain this upward trend over time.</p><h3 id=using-the-sp-500-index-as-an-investment-strategy>Using the S&amp;P 500 Index as an Investment Strategy</h3><p>An individual &ldquo;investing in the S&amp;P 500&rdquo; would theoretically need to replicate the index by constructing a portfolio containing all 500 stocks included in the S&amp;P 500, with each stock held in proportion to its weight in the index. To maintain alignment with the S&amp;P 500, the investor would also need to regularly adjust their holdings, typically quarterly, to account for the index&rsquo;s rebalancing, which reflects changes in the stock list or the weights of the stocks.</p><p>In practice, this process is handled by financial professionals known as asset managers. They create and manage index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to replicate the performance of indexes like the S&amp;P 500. By investing in these funds, individuals can gain exposure to the entire index without the complexity of purchasing and managing all 500 stocks themselves. These funds are rebalanced by the asset managers to ensure they remain aligned with the index.</p><p>Asset managers create a wide variety of funds based on strategies other than replicating the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index. However, the majority of these funds tend to deliver returns that are lower than those of the S&amp;P 500, especially over longer time horizons.</p><p>The SPIVA Scorecard is a report published by S&amp;P Global that compares the performance of actively managed investment funds against their corresponding benchmark, such as the S&amp;P 500. In its <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2023.pdf?gclid=undefined">2023 report</a>, SPIVA found that:</p><ul><li>87.42% of U.S. Large-Cap Equity Funds underperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index over a 10-year investment horizon.</li><li>93.03% underperformed over a 20-year investment horizon.</li></ul><blockquote><p>These statistics present an enigma: how can the S&amp;P 500 consistently outperform the vast majority of financial investment professionals?</p></blockquote><h3 id=the-survivorship-bias-of-the-sp-500>The Survivorship Bias of the S&amp;P 500</h3><p>A <a href=https://media.realvision.com/wp/20210811211515/The-Capitalism-Distribution.-Total-Lifetime-Returns-for-individual-U.S.-stocks-1983-to-PDF-Free-Download.pdf>study</a> titled <em>“The Capitalism Distribution”</em>, conducted by Eric Crittenden and Cole Wilcox from BlackStar Funds, analyzed the returns of all common stocks that traded on U.S. stock exchanges between 1983 and 2006. This data set included approximately 8,000 stocks, including those that were eventually delisted. The study found that the average annualized return of all stocks was <strong>-1.06%</strong>.</p><p>This finding is particularly intriguing given that the S&amp;P 500 Total Return Index achieved a return of approximately <strong>+1796%</strong> during the same period, while the average return of all stocks was negative.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is market capitalization-weighted, meaning that companies with higher stock prices and larger market values have a greater influence on the index&rsquo;s performance. Successful companies with rising stock prices naturally account for a larger portion of the index, while companies with declining stock prices have less impact. Over time, struggling companies that fail to recover are removed from the index, and growing companies are added to take their place.</p><p>The systematic replacement process of the S&amp;P 500 introduces survivorship bias, as it replaces struggling companies with growing ones. This approach has demonstrated the ability to generate positive returns even in a market where the average stock return is negative.</p><blockquote><p>If buying stocks with positive trends proves to be a profitable strategy, could investors use this insight to create a more advanced trading strategy?</p></blockquote><h3 id=momentum-or-trend-following-trading>Momentum or Trend-Following Trading</h3><p>A <a href=https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/finread/trend.pdf>study</a> by Eric Crittenden and Cole Wilcox from BlackStar Funds, titled <em>“Does Trend Following Work on Stocks?”</em>, suggests that trend-following strategies can be highly effective for trading stocks.</p><p>The researchers backtested a trend-following (or momentum) trading strategy on U.S. stocks from 1983 to 2004. The results showed the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Winning trades</strong> had an average return of 51.2%.</li><li><strong>Losing trades</strong> had an average return of -20%.</li></ul><p>To determine how often a trader needs to be correct for the strategy to break-even, we can calculate the break-even probability using this equation:</p><p><img src=/images/equation.png alt=Equation></p><p><em>P</em> represents the probability of a winning trade, and <em>(1-P)</em> the probability of a losing trade. Assuming a fixed investment amount for each trade, solving this equation gives <em>P = 28.1%</em>. This means that as long as the trader is correct more than 28.1% of the time, the strategy will be profitable in the long run.</p><p>In their study, the authors found that their strategy had a win rate of 49.3%, well above the break-even point. Further calculations suggested the strategy was significantly profitable, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 while maintaining limited drawdowns.</p><p>The break-even equation is based on expected values, which are long-term averages. Over a large number of trades, the actual results will converge to these averages, making the calculated break-even point of 28.1% valid regardless of the return distribution. However, in practice, variance introduces challenges:</p><ul><li><strong>Short-term underperformance</strong>: Prolonged periods of small wins or occasional large losses can lead to unattractive returns in the short-term.</li><li><strong>Emotional strain</strong>: Traders might abandon a profitable strategy due to the psychological difficulty of enduring these fluctuations.</li><li><strong>Capital requirements</strong>: The potential for rare but significant losses requires sufficient capital to absorb drawdowns during periods of short-term variance.</li></ul><p>This study introduces important concepts about trend-following or momentum trading:</p><ul><li><strong>Anomaly Exploit</strong>: Momentum strategies exploit recurring behavior patterns of other investors to outperform benchmarks like the S&amp;P 500 while limiting drawdowns.</li><li><strong>Risk Management</strong>: To handle the short-term variance, effective risk management is essential, including bankroll management and exit strategies.</li></ul><h3 id=the-similarities-between-momentum-trading-and-poker>The Similarities Between Momentum Trading and Poker</h3><p>Both a momentum trader and a poker player operate as investors, navigating incomplete information, uncertainty, and variance in pursuit of returns.</p><p>They manage short-term fluctuations by practicing effective bankroll management, ensuring they can sustain periods of loss while waiting for favorable outcomes. Both understand that accepting losses is part of gaining exposure to opportunities for success.</p><p>Both capitalize on recurring human behavioral patterns, using these tendencies to gain a statistical edge.</p><p>Their focus is on controlling what they can control: making decisions with a positive expected value. A good decision can still lead to a loss, and a bad decision can lead to a win. While they cannot control the outcome of each decision, they can focus on making the best possible choices in the present moment, trusting that their statistical edge will benefit them over time.</p><p>They also understand that doing more—trading more stocks or playing more hands—does not guarantee better results. Success depends on selecting opportunities with the greatest statistical advantage. For momentum trading, this means only choosing assets that fully meet the criteria of the strategy and trading during favorable market conditions. In poker, this means selecting games where opponents are weaker and studying pre-flop ranges to select hands that provide a statistical edge.</p><p>Finally, both momentum traders and poker players have strong self-awareness. They understand how emotions can influence their decisions.</p><p>Many professional poker players eventually transition into trading, as the skills required for both are similar. A well-known example is Karl Chappé-Gatien, also known as High Stakes Capital, who successfully applied the strategies and discipline he developed at the poker table to his trading career.</p><blockquote><p>This post introduced the concept of momentum trading but did not cover how to develop an investment strategy to take advantage of this anomaly.
