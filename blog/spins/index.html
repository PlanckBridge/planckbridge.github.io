In this article, I’ll explain key concepts in statistics, using Spin and Go poker tournaments as a practical example of how individuals can leverage statistics to their advantage. I’ll also explore the similarities between professional poker players and financial traders, highlighting how both use their understanding of statistics and human behavior to succeed in a world driven by randomness.</p><h2 id=the-similarities-between-insurance-companies-and-lotteries>The Similarities Between Insurance Companies and Lotteries</h2><p>Between 2004 and 2024, the EuroMillions lottery awarded a total of 429 jackpots, with an average jackpot of €58,587,250, according to their <a href=https://www.euro-millions.com/winners/statistics>website</a>. How does this lottery stay confident that it will remain profitable while offering such high payouts?</p><p>The answer lies in a fundamental principle of mathematics: the Law of Large Numbers (LLN). Let’s use a simple example to visualize how this works: rolling a die.</p><p>When you roll a die, you can’t predict which number will come up because all six numbers have an equal chance. But if you roll the die many times, patterns start to emerge. On average, each number appears about once every six rolls. For instance, if you roll a die 1,000 times, you’ll notice that the number 1 (or any other number on the die) shows up close to one-sixth of the time. To visualize this, I used Python to create a Monte Carlo simulation of a player rolling a die 1,000 times:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/die1.png alt=Die1></p><p>The blue line in the simulation shows how the average frequency of rolling a 1 changes as the player rolls the die repeatedly. At first, the average frequency may vary a lot, but as the number of rolls increases, it stabilizes. Even though each roll is random, the average outcome becomes more predictable. This is the essence of the Law of Large Numbers: when random events are repeated many times, their average result becomes increasingly stable.</p><p>The EuroMillions lottery works similarly. Playing the lottery is like trying to guess the result of a single roll of a die. However, instead of a 1-in-6 chance, your odds of picking the winning EuroMillions combination are about 1 in 140 million. Over time, as millions of tickets are sold, the lottery can accurately predict how often someone will win. Let’s extend the dice example to see how predictability improves with more trials. For instance, if we simulate rolling a die 100,000 times:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/die2.png alt=Die2></p><p>Here, the blue line shows that the average frequency of rolling a 1 becomes even more stable as the number of rolls increases. Similarly, as more lottery tickets are sold, the average frequency of jackpot wins becomes more stable.</p><p>This predictability allows lotteries to set ticket prices strategically. By knowing how often they’ll need to pay out jackpots, they can calculate how much they’ll pay in total. They then price tickets so that the revenue from sales exceeds the payouts, ensuring profitability in the long run.</p><p>Insurance companies operate similarly: a group of participants pays a small fee in exchange for a promise of compensation if a rare event—such as an accident—occurs. However, the insurance game is far more complex than guessing a number between 1 and 140 million. Unlike lotteries, where the odds are fixed and known, the probabilities of rare events in insurance are often uncertain and can be influenced by the participants themselves—for example, by driving safely or adopting preventive measures.</p><h2 id=spin-and-go-poker-tournaments>Spin and Go Poker Tournaments</h2><p>Spin and Go poker tournaments (Spins) combine elements of both lotteries and insurance. Like lotteries, the probabilities and payouts are fixed and known. However, as in insurance, players’ decisions influence how payouts are distributed among them.</p><p>Spins operate in two distinct phases:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Lottery Phase</strong><br>In this phase, a random draw determines the tournament prize. The possible prizes and their probabilities are fixed and known, and players have no control over the outcome.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Poker Phase</strong><br>Once the prize is set, a poker game determines who wins it. Unlike the lottery phase, the outcomes and their probabilities are uncertain, as they depend on the players’ decisions during the game.</p></li></ol><h3 id=1-the-lottery-phase>1. The Lottery Phase</h3><p>Three players each pay a buy-in fee to participate, much like buying a ticket in a lottery. After all players have paid, a random draw determines the payout pool for the game. For $10 buy-ins, the possible payouts and their respective probabilities are as follows:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/payout10.png alt=Payout10></p><p>Note that the average payout, taking into account the chances of each outcome, is $27.90.</p><p>As with the earlier die example, I used Python to simulate multiple tournaments to observe how the average payout can stabilize over time:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/spin1.png alt=Spin1></p><p>In the simulation, the blue line shows the evolution of the average payout per tournament as more tournaments are played. Initially, the average varies significantly, but as the number of tournaments increases, the payout stabilizes. Increasing the number of tournaments to 100,000 further highlights this stabilization:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/spin2.png alt=Spin2></p><p>Eventually, the average payout converges to the expected value of $27.90 per tournament. Since each tournament involves three players paying $10 each ($30 total), the organizer retains a profit of $30 – $27.90 = $2.10 per tournament on average. This 7% profit margin, known as the rake, represents the organiser’s earnings for running the tournaments. In this case, the organiser is PokerStars.</p><p>If the game ended here, it would be a simple lottery: all players would have the same probability of winning the payout, and they would lose, on average, 7% of their buy-in each time they played. As a player, the expected return on investment (ROI) for such a game could be modeled as:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/roir.png alt=Roir></p><p>where r is the rake.</p><p>However, much like insurance contracts, Spins are more complex than simple lotteries. While the total payout functions as a lottery where the organiser (PokerStars) always wins in the long run, the distribution of the payout among players depends on their actions once they enter the contract.</p><h3 id=2-the-poker-phase>2. The Poker Phase</h3><p>In the poker phase, players compete against each other in a game to determine who wins the payout. At the start of the tournament, each player exchanges their buy-in for 500 chips. During the game, these chips move from one player to another. To win the tournament and secure first place, a player must collect all 1,500 chips in play.</p><p>From a chips perspective, there are only two possible outcomes for a player at the end of a tournament:</p><ul><li><strong>First Place:</strong> The player won 1,000 chips.</li><li><strong>Not First Place:</strong> The player lost 500 chips.</li></ul><p>This means that a player’s win rate is proportional to the average number of chips they win per game. We can model a player’s win rate based on their average chips won per game as:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/win.png alt=Win></p><p>where c is the average chips won per game.</p><p>We can also model the average payout a winner receives in terms of chips. With three players contributing 500 chips each (1,500 chips total), PokerStars redistributes, on average, 1500 x (1 – r) chips to the winner, where r is the rake. The average payout equation expressed as chips is:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/payout.png alt=Payout></p><p>Now that we have these elements, we can model the average ROI a player achieves based on their win rate, which depends on the average chips they win per game. The average ROI derivation is as follows:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/roifull.png alt=Roifull></p><p>where w is the win rate, r is the rake, and c is the average chips won per game.</p><p>The most important takeaway is the relationship between ROI, average chips won per game, and the rake. Specifically, the following ROI equation:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/roifinal.png alt=Roifinal></p><p>If players couldn’t influence their win rate, their average chips won per game would be zero (c = 0), and the ROI equation would simplify to the lottery ROI model. In the lottery model, the rake directly determines the ROI, which is always negative for the player.</p><p>To break even and compensate for the rake taken by PokerStars, a player must achieve a positive average chips won per game. By setting ROI = 0 and isolating c, we derive the average chips won per game a player must reach to break even:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/roieven.png alt=Roieven></p><p>For $10 stakes, where the rake is 7%, substituting r = 7% gives a break-even point of 37.63 chips per game. This means that, on average, a player needs to win at least 37.63 chips per game to avoid losing money.</p><p>Since the average chips won per game (c) is proportional to the win rate, we can calculate the corresponding break-even win rate by substituting c into the win rate equation. The result is a win rate of 35.84%. In other words, to break even on average, a player must win slightly more than 1 in every 3 tournaments.</p><h2 id=monte-carlo-simulation-of-spins>Monte Carlo Simulation of Spins</h2><p>I created a Monte Carlo <a href=https://spins-simulation.streamlit.app/>simulation</a> in Python that models Spin and Go tournaments using the same payout structure as real tournaments. The simulation derives a player’s probability of winning a game from their expected average chips won per game. For players who do not finish first, the model assumes equal probabilities of finishing second or third. While exact probabilities for second and third place are not precisely calculable, this assumption has minimal impact on the model because:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Winner-Takes-All Tournaments:</strong> 98.91% of tournaments follow a winner-takes-all format, where only the first-place player receives a payout.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shared Payout Tournaments:</strong> In the remaining 1.09% of tournaments, where payouts are shared among players, the first-place player takes at least 80% of the total payout, leaving little to distribute among the other two players.</p></li></ol><p>For $10 stakes, the payout structure is as follows:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/p10s.png alt=P10s></p><h3 id=simulation-1-player-with-no-influence-on-chips-c0>Simulation 1: Player with No Influence on Chips (c=0)</h3><p>In this scenario, we analyze a player who participates in 10,000 Spin and Go tournaments but has no influence on the outcome—meaning their average chips won per game is zero (c=0). For this setup, I ran 5,000 simulations, each simulating 10,000 tournaments.</p><p>The graph below illustrates 100 out of the 5,000 simulations, providing a visual representation of the trends a player might experience. While the graph focuses on a subset of the simulations, the key statistics below are calculated based on all 5,000 simulations.</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/gchip0.png alt=Gchip0></p><p>Each line represents a simulation of 10,000 tournaments played with an expected average chips won per game of zero (c=0).</p><p><strong>Key Statistics across 5,000 simulations:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Average cumulative profit/loss:</strong> –$7,008</li><li><strong>Average ROI:</strong> –7.01%</li><li><strong>Median ROI:</strong> –7.04%</li><li><strong>Percentage of simulations with negative ROI:</strong> 99.98%</li></ul><p>The results of the simulations align with the expected value derived from the ROI equation: if a player has no influence on the chips they win per game, they will lose, on average, the rake (7% for $10 tournaments).</p><p>The distribution of ROI across all 5,000 simulations is shown in the box plot below:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/boxchip0.png alt=Boxchip0></p><p>The box plot highlights an interesting observation: among the 5,000 simulations, there is an extreme outlier. One player achieved a positive ROI of 6.85%, while 99% of players had an ROI lower than –3.53%. This outlier occurred because the player participated in an extraordinarily rare event: a tournament with the highest prize pool of $120,000, where they finished in 2nd place and won $12,000. This rare event influenced the average ROI across all simulations, pulling it slightly upward. However, the median ROI, which is less affected by such outliers, was slightly lower than the average ROI.</p><p>This observation provides a key insight into Spins: for players to experience the theoretical rake (as defined by PokerStars), they must participate in all possible tournaments at their theoretical frequency, including those with the highest prize pools. If a player plays the highest-multiplier tournaments at a lower frequency than the theoretical frequency, the effective rake they pay becomes higher than the theoretical rake, which in turn lowers their ROI.</p><p>For example, in $10 games, if we exclude the top two multipliers from the prize pool distribution, the average payout (factoring in probabilities) drops from $27.90 to $27.838. This small decrease translates into an effective rake of 7.21% instead of 7%, making it harder for players to break even.</p><p>The stakes where this difference has the most significant impact are $5 Spins. If you exclude the top two prize pools, the effective rake increases to 8.97%, compared to the theoretical rake of 8% if all prizes were played at their theoretical frequency. It’s important to note the rarity of the top two prize pools: the probability of playing in the highest prize pool is 1 in 10 million, and the probability of playing in the second-highest prize pool is 1 in 20,000. This rarity means that many players might never experience these high multipliers at their expected frequency, resulting in them effectively paying a higher rake than expected.</p><h3 id=simulation-2-break-even-player-with-consistent-influence-on-chips-won-c3763>Simulation 2: Break-Even Player with Consistent Influence on Chips Won (c=37.63)</h3><p>In this scenario, we analyze a player who can consistently influence the number of chips they win per game. Specifically, the player’s expected chips won per game is set to the theoretical break-even value derived earlier (c = 37.63). For this setup, I also ran 5,000 simulations, each simulating 10,000 tournaments.</p><p>As in the previous simulation, the graph below illustrates 100 of the 5,000 simulations, providing a visual representation of the potential trends. The key statistics, however, are calculated based on all 5,000 simulations.</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/gchip37.png alt=Gchip37></p><p>Each line represents a simulation of 10,000 tournaments played with an expected average chips won per game of 37.63 (c = 37.63).</p><p><strong>Key Statistics across 5,000 simulations:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Average cumulative profit/loss:</strong> –$22</li><li><strong>Average ROI:</strong> –0.02%</li><li><strong>Median ROI:</strong> –0.09%</li><li><strong>Percentage of simulations with negative ROI:</strong> 52.16%</li></ul><p>The results align closely with the expected value derived from the ROI equation, which predicts the average player will break even. However, the actual results are slightly lower than the theoretical prediction. This discrepancy occurs because, for players to fully realize the theoretical rake, they must play an extremely large number of tournaments to encounter the rare top multipliers at the expected frequency. We can visualize the extreme and rare outliers using a box plot:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/boxchip37.png alt=Boxchip37></p><h3 id=simulation-3-winning-player-with-significant-edge-c65>Simulation 3: Winning Player with Significant Edge (c=65)</h3><p>In this scenario, we analyze a player with a significant skill advantage who consistently influences the number of chips they win per game. The player’s expected chips won per game is set to 65 (c = 65), corresponding to a theoretical ROI of 5.09%. For this setup, I ran 5,000 simulations, each simulating 10,000 tournaments.</p><p>As in the previous simulations, the graph below illustrates 100 out of the 5,000 simulations, providing a visual representation of the potential trends. The key statistics, however, are calculated based on all 5,000 simulations.</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/gchip65.png alt=Gchip65></p><p>Each line represents a simulation of 10,000 tournaments played with an expected average chips won per game of 65 (c = 65).</p><p><strong>Key Statistics across 5,000 simulations:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Average cumulative profit/loss:</strong> $4,936</li><li><strong>Average ROI:</strong> 4.94%</li><li><strong>Median ROI:</strong> 4.88%</li><li><strong>Percentage of simulations with negative ROI:</strong> 0.08%</li></ul><p>The results align closely with the theoretical prediction, though the actual results are slightly lower. This deviation is consistent with earlier observations and can be attributed to the practical challenges of hitting high-multiplier tournaments at the expected frequency.</p><p>Interestingly, if we recalculate the expected ROI using the rake of 7.21%—the rake excluding the top two multipliers from the payouts—the predicted ROI decreases from 5.09% to 4.86%. This value is remarkably close to the median ROI observed across the 5,000 simulations. Since prize pools include extreme outliers, the median ROI serves as a more reliable predictor of a player’s actual ROI than the average ROI.</p><p>The box plot below illustrates the distribution of ROI across all simulations:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/boxchip65.png alt=Boxchip65></p><h2 id=risk-analysis>Risk Analysis</h2><p>In poker tournaments, the buy-in represents a unit of risk, similar to how the standard deviation of a stock price is a unit of risk in finance. The maximum a player can lose in a single tournament is their buy-in. By tracking the accumulation of these losses across simulations, we can measure the risk a player faces over the course of 10,000 tournaments.</p><p>Just as financial investors track the maximum drawdown—the worst decline in their investment value—we can track the maximum drawdown of a poker player in terms of buy-ins. This metric reflects the maximum loss a player experiences during their tournaments, expressed in buy-ins.</p><h3 id=max-drawdown-for-a-skilled-player-c65>Max Drawdown for a Skilled Player (c=65)</h3><p>For a skilled player with c=65 (a significant edge), the distribution of maximum drawdowns across 5,000 simulations is shown below:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/boxdown65.png alt=Boxdown65></p><p><strong>Key Statistics across 5,000 simulations:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Average Max Drawdown:</strong> 83 buy-ins</li><li><strong>Median Max Drawdown:</strong> 79 buy-ins</li><li><strong>25th Percentile:</strong> 65 buy-ins</li><li><strong>75th Percentile:</strong> 96 buy-ins</li><li><strong>97th Percentile:</strong> 143 buy-ins</li><li><strong>99th Percentile:</strong> 167 buy-ins</li></ul><p>Even though this player had a significant edge and consistently made decisions with positive expected value (c=65), they faced an average maximum drawdown of 83 buy-ins ($830) across the simulations. Furthermore, 50% of simulations experienced a maximum drawdown between 65 and 96 buy-ins, and there was a 75% chance of encountering a drawdown of at least 65 buy-ins—even when playing optimally throughout all tournaments.</p><p>Interestingly, this skilled player lost on average 61.96% of the tournaments they played across the simulations. However, once the simulations concluded, 99.92% of them had a positive ROI.</p><blockquote><p><strong>How can a player who loses 61.96% of the time have a 99.92% probability of achieving a positive ROI?</strong></p></blockquote><p>The answer lies in the asymmetry of risk and reward in poker tournaments:</p><ul><li>When the player <strong>loses</strong>, they lose their $10 buy-in (1 buy-in).</li><li>When the player <strong>wins</strong>, they win an average payout of $27.90 (2.79 buy-ins).</li></ul><p>This creates a favorable risk/reward ratio: risking 1 buy-in to potentially profit 1.79 buy-ins.</p><h2 id=comparison-with-momentum-trading>Comparison with Momentum Trading</h2><p>This asymmetry in risk and reward is analogous to momentum trading strategies in financial markets, as discussed in my <a href=https://planckbridge.github.io/blog/stock-indexes/>post</a> on stock indexes. In their <a href=https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/finread/trend.pdf>study</a> <em>Does Trend Following Work on Stocks?</em> Eric Crittenden and Cole Wilcox employed a trend-following strategy: buying stocks with positive momentum and using stop-losses to cap losses when momentum reversed.</p><p>In their study:</p><ul><li>Winning trades had an average return of 51.2%.</li><li>Losing trades had an average return of –20%.</li></ul><p>By capping losses and allowing for unlimited gains, the researchers created a similar risk/reward asymmetry as poker tournaments. This strategy allowed traders to break even if they won just 28.1% of their trades. The frequency (P) at which traders must be correct in order to break even can be modeled as:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/tradeeven.png alt=Tradeeven></p><p>Knowing that a trader risks, on average, a loss of 20% for a gain of 51.2%, we can simplify the model to visualize the profit they can expect per percentage point of loss—referred to here as a unit of risk. By dividing the average gain (51.2%) by the average loss (20%), we find that the expected profit is 2.56% per 1% of risk.</p><p>This leads to the momentum trading model expressed in units of risk:</p><ul><li>Winning trades yield an average profit of 2.56 units of risk.</li><li>Losing trades yield an average loss of 1 unit of risk.</li></ul><p>Risking 1 unit to have a profit of 2.56 units means traders need to win just 1 / (1 + 2.56) = 28.1% of the time to break even.</p><p>In Spin and Go poker tournaments:</p><ul><li>Winning tournaments yield an average profit of 1.79 buy-ins.</li><li>Losing tournaments result in a loss of exactly 1 buy-in.</li></ul><p>Risking 1 buy-in to have a profit of 1.79 buy-ins means a player only needs to win 1 / (1 + 1.79) = 35.84% of their tournaments to break even.</p><h2 id=variance>Variance</h2><p>According to the Law of Large Numbers, both poker players and traders will eventually realize their expected profits if they consistently apply their strategy and participate in enough tournaments or make enough trades. However, achieving these expected profits requires significant repetition to encounter rare, high-impact events.</p><p>For a poker player, this means playing enough tournaments to participate in high-payout games at their expected frequency. Similarly, in their <a href=https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/finread/trend.pdf>study</a> <em>Does Trend Following Work on Stocks?</em>, Eric Crittenden and Cole Wilcox found that the returns of their trades exhibited a fat-tail distribution. Trades with extremely high returns (over 300% ROI) had a significant impact on the average return but occurred far less frequently than smaller, more common winning trades. To capture these extreme winners at their expected frequency and realize their expected returns, a trader must execute a large number of trades.</p><p>In the short term, both poker players and traders face the challenge of variance. While the Law of Large Numbers ensures that the actual average results of repeated random events stabilize over the long run, in the short term, randomness can cause significant deviations from the expected value. This effect, as illustrated in the die example, highlights how individual outcomes can create substantial fluctuations before long-term patterns emerge.</p><h3 id=visualizing-short-term-variance>Visualizing Short-Term Variance</h3><p>To illustrate short-term variance, we can simulate the performance of the skilled poker player (c=65). This time, instead of simulating 10,000 tournaments, we will simulate 100 tournaments to observe the range of possible outcomes in the short term.</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/g100.png alt=G100></p><p>Even though this player has significant skill (c=65), the outcomes of 100 tournaments are far less stable compared to when they played 10,000 tournaments.</p><p><strong>Key Statistics Across 5,000 Simulations (100 Tournaments):</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Average ROI:</strong> 4.81%</li><li><strong>Median ROI:</strong> 4.00%</li><li><strong>Percentage of simulations with negative ROI:</strong> 36.62%</li></ul><p>Although the average ROI is relatively close to the expected ROI, the likelihood of a negative ROI increased significantly when playing only 100 tournaments instead of 10,000 tournaments:</p><ul><li>For 100 tournaments: 36.62% of simulations had a negative ROI.</li><li>For 10,000 tournaments: 0.08% of simulations had a negative ROI.</li></ul><p>The distribution of ROI for 100 tournaments further highlights the impact of short-term variance:</p><ul><li>For 100 tournaments: 50% of simulations had an ROI between –5% and 14%.</li><li>For 10,000 tournaments: 50% of simulations had an ROI between 3.86% and 5.88%.</li></ul><p>The box plot below illustrates the significantly wider spread of possible ROIs when playing only 100 tournaments:</p><p><img src=/images/spins-images/box100.png alt=Box100></p><p>By comparing the possible outcomes of playing 100 tournaments versus 10,000 tournaments, it becomes clear that the fewer times a random event is repeated, the more likely it is to deviate from the expected results. Similarly, just as a poker player must play many tournaments to increase the likelihood of realizing their expected gains, a trader must execute a large number of trades to improve their probability of achieving their expected returns. The key is to develop an effective risk management plan to manage short-term variance, ensuring the player or trader has sufficient cash reserves to withstand the highly probable losses in the short term.</p><p>For example, for the skilled poker player (c=65), across 5,000 simulations of 10,000 tournaments, 99% of simulations experienced a maximum drawdown of 167 buy-ins or less. This suggests that maintaining a bankroll (cash reserve) of at least 167 buy-ins at all times would give the player a 99% probability of avoiding bankruptcy. This buffer ensures the player can continue participating in tournaments, increasing their chances of realizing their expected profits over time.</p><p>The required bankroll size depends on the player’s win rate, which is determined by their skill level (c). A lower win rate increases the variance in results, requiring a larger bankroll to manage potential losses. For example, I ran another 5,000 simulations of 10,000 tournaments for a player with an expected chips won per game of 50 (c=50) and compared the results to a skilled player with c=65:</p><ul><li><strong>For c=50:</strong> The 99th percentile of maximum drawdowns was 272 buy-ins.</li><li><strong>For c=65:</strong> The 99th percentile of maximum drawdowns was 167 buy-ins.</li></ul><p>This means that a player with an expected chips won per game of 50 would need to maintain a bankroll of at least 272 buy-ins to avoid bankruptcy with 99% probability. In contrast, a more skilled player (c=65) would only need 167 buy-ins to achieve the same level of security.</p><h2 id=key-learning-points>Key Learning Points</h2><p>Studying variance through Spin and Go tournaments provides a relatively simple framework compared to financial markets for visualizing and understanding key principles of dealing with randomness. Notable lessons include:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Risk/Reward Asymmetry</strong><br>In both poker tournaments and trading, the goal isn’t merely to be right or wrong—it’s to minimize losses when wrong and maximize gains when right. If you lose 1 unit when wrong but win multiple units when right, you don’t need to be right often to be profitable. This asymmetry is a fundamental element of successful strategies in both domains.</p></li><li><p><strong>Return per Unit of Risk and Money Management</strong><br>In financial theory, the best investments are those that provide the highest return per unit of risk, often measured by the Sharpe ratio. Modeling returns per unit of risk in Spin and Go tournaments is relatively simple and serves as a foundation for creating similar models for more complex return distributions, such as those seen in momentum trading strategies—a topic I will explore in a future post.</p><p>For now, the Spins model illustrates an important principle: a poker player should adjust their bankroll based on their expected return per unit of risk. Proper bankroll management ensures they have enough cash reserves to withstand short-term variance and avoid going bankrupt before realizing their long-term expected profits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consistency and Repetition Are Key</strong><br>Both poker players and traders deal with random variables. For their strategies to achieve expected outcomes, they must be applied consistently over a large number of repetitions. This requires discipline. For example, the winning poker player spent much of their time losing money and endured periods of repeated losses. By maintaining adequate bankroll requirements and consistently applying their strategy, they were able to overcome short-term variance. However, in practice, repeated losing streaks can lead to negative emotions that may cause deviations from the optimal strategy. Overcoming this emotional challenge is essential for long-term success.</p></li></ol><h2 id=the-similarities-between-momentum-trading-and-poker>The Similarities Between Momentum Trading and Poker</h2><p>Both a momentum trader and a poker player operate as investors, navigating incomplete information, uncertainty, and variance in pursuit of returns.</p><ul><li>They manage short-term fluctuations by practicing effective bankroll management, ensuring they can sustain periods of loss while waiting for favorable outcomes. Both understand that accepting losses is part of gaining exposure to opportunities for success.</li><li>They capitalize on recurring human behavioral patterns, using these tendencies to gain a statistical edge.</li><li>Their focus is on controlling what they can control: making decisions with a positive expected value. A good decision can still lead to a loss, and a bad decision can lead to a win. While they cannot control the outcome of each decision, they can focus on making the best possible choices in the present moment, trusting that their statistical edge will benefit them over time.</li><li>They also understand that doing more—trading more stocks or playing more hands—does not guarantee better results. Success depends on selecting opportunities with the greatest statistical advantage. For momentum trading, this means only choosing assets that fully meet the criteria of the strategy and trading during favorable market conditions. In poker, this means selecting games where opponents are weaker and studying pre-flop ranges to select hands that provide a statistical edge.</li><li>Finally, both momentum traders and poker players have strong self-awareness. They understand how emotions can influence their decisions.</li></ul><p>Many professional poker players eventually transition into trading, as the skills required for both are similar. A well-known example is Karl Chappé-Gatien, also known as High Stakes Capital, who successfully applied the strategies and discipline he developed at the poker table to his trading career.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://planckbridge.github.io/>&copy;</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
